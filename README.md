# pfSense Firewall Labs

## Objective
This section showcases hands-on experience with pfSense, an open-source firewall platform. Tasks include configuring VLANs, NAT, VPNs, and managing network traffic with advanced monitoring and troubleshooting techniques.

## Skills Learned
- Configuring VLANs and DHCP services.
- Setting up and managing NAT and port forwarding.
- Implementing VPN tunneling and PKI for secure communication.
- Monitoring and analyzing system logs and network interfaces.
- Troubleshooting connectivity and configuration issues.

## Tools Used
- pfSense WebGUI and CLI
- OpenVPN for VPN tunneling
- Wireshark for network analysis
- Syslog Servers for logging
- Virtualized network environments

## Tasks
Below are the key tasks performed:

### 1. VLAN and Interface Configuration
- Configured VLANs for network segmentation and better traffic management.
- Assigned and edited interfaces for specific VLANs.

### 2. DHCP and NAT Setup
- Enabled and verified DHCP services for automatic IP assignment.
- Configured Source NAT (SNAT) and Port Forwarding to manage external connections.

### 3. VPN and PKI Implementation
- Set up site-to-site and remote-access VPN tunnels using OpenVPN.
- Configured Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for secure authentication.

### 4. Traffic Monitoring and Logs
- Monitored real-time traffic on WAN and LAN interfaces.
- Analyzed system and DHCP logs for troubleshooting and optimization.

### 5. Firewall Rules Management
- Created and managed firewall rules to control traffic flow between VLANs and networks.
- Fine-tuned rules to enhance network security.

### 6. Advanced Troubleshooting
- Diagnosed configuration errors affecting NAT and VPN connectivity.
- Performed packet capture using Wireshark for deep analysis.
